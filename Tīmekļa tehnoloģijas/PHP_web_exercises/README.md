### `part3.php`.
The `mounthly_paiment_count()` function calculates the monthly loan payment using the annuity formula.

Formula:

M = P \* (i(1 + i)^n) / ((1 + i)^n - 1)

````
Where:
- `P` - loan amount
- `i` - monthly interest rate
- `n` - number of months

The file contains several tests of the function and outputs the results.
